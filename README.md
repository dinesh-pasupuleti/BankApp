# Project Overview

This Android banking application, developed using Android Studio with Java, serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in Android development. It adheres to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, implementing robust programming practices such as documentation, error handling, efficient memory management, and adherence to programming conventions.

The app initiates with a login screen where users can either sign in with existing profiles or create new ones. Upon successful login, users are directed to their dashboard, where they can manage their accounts and perform banking operations. Navigation within the app is facilitated through a slide-out menu, providing access to various features including account overview, transactions, deposits, payments, transfers, profile settings, and logout options.

# Key Android Development Concepts Employed

- **Multiple Activities and Fragments**: The app employs multiple activities to manage different screens and fragments to handle distinct UI components and functionalities. Intents are used for communication between activities, while Bundles facilitate data exchange between fragments.

- **UI Layout Design**: The app incorporates well-designed layouts to ensure simplicity and optimal functionality. Custom toolbars are utilized for consistent navigation and user options across the app's screens.

- **DrawerLayout**: A DrawerLayout is implemented to enable a sliding menu from the left side of the screen, providing access to various features of the application.

- **SQLite Database**: All essential user data such as profiles, accounts, payees, and transactions are stored in an SQLite database, ensuring efficient data management on the user's device.

- **Shared Preferences**: User session information and other relevant data are stored using Shared Preferences, enabling efficient data retrieval and management across different activities. JSON format is utilized for data serialization.

- **Array Adapters**: Custom array adapters are employed to display information in list views and spinners, enhancing the user experience.

# Notable Features

- **Material Design Guidelines**: The app adheres to Google's Material Design guidelines, reflecting in its icons, toolbar, and overall UI design.

- **Resource Management**: Best practices are followed for managing string resources, colors, drawables, and styles.

- **Compatibility**: The application is designed to run seamlessly on Android devices with API 19 and above.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Android development principles and showcases practical skills in building a robust banking application for the Android platform.
